# Wish - UAC CTF Challenge

These are the files for the challenge **_Wish_** of UAC CTF, organized by **Erdembileg Ariunbold**, the president of the Cybersecurity Club at the University of Utah Asia Campus.

## Challenge Overview

The **_Wish_** challenge features a simple **buffer overflow** vulnerability, designed to help participants understand and exploit common memory management errors in software.

### Objective

By carefully crafting input that exceeds the allocated buffer size, participants will have the opportunity to:
- Overwrite adjacent memory
- Gain control of the execution flow

This challenge is a great way to practice identifying and exploiting **buffer overflow** vulnerabilities.
