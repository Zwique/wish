These are the files for the challenge <mark style="color: #025ef2">Wish</mark> of UAC CTF, organized by Erdembileg Ariunbold, the president of the Cybersecurity Club at the University of Utah Asia Campus.

The challenge features a simple <mark style="color: #f20202">buffer overflow</mark> vulnerability, designed to help participants understand and exploit common memory management errors in software. By carefully crafting input that exceeds the allocated buffer size, participants will have the opportunity to overwrite adjacent memory and gain control of the execution flow.
